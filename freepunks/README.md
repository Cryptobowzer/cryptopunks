## What is the "right-clicker mentality"!?

> Quite literally, it is referring to one's ability to right-click
> on any image you see online to bring up a menu
> and select the "save" option in order to save a copy of the image
> to your device. In this term we have a microcosm of
> the entire philosophical debate surrounding non-fungible [art] tokens.
>  Non-fungible [art] tokens, are unique tokens on the blockchain ostensibly
> representing a receipt of ownership pointing to some (usually) digital thing,
> like a JPEG hosted on a server somewhere.
> To be an non-fungible [art] token collector is to philosophically buy
> into the idea that owning this string of numbers means you "own" a JPEG
> that lesser people simply right-click to save on their own machines
> at any time [for free].
>
> [...]
>
> This entire idea of owning an infinitely-copyable
> bundle of pixels because it says so on a digital list called a blockchain
> is a profit-seeking farce.
> Right-clicking a JPEG, saving it, and displaying it back
> to the non-fungible [art] token owner a way to point out the Emperor has no clothes.
